#summary Accepted input models.

= Introduction =

The only accepted file format in the moment is the
Stanford PLY format.

= Details =

The repository already includeds the _ply.c_ and _ply.h_ files. These have been a little modified to compile without warnings. Unfornately, to my knowledge, the ply library was built specifically for 32-bits architectures, so if you are running on a 64-bits machine you'll not be able to use binary plys, only ascii plys.

To convert from binary to ascii use the *ply2ascii* program in the ply library.

The accepted _ply_ files must have two more attributes besides the vertex coordinates:

  * Normals
  * Radius

===Vertex Normals===

Vertex normals can be computed using the ply library
