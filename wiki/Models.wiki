#summary Accepted input models.

The only accepted file format in the moment is the
Stanford PLY format.

= Details =

The repository already includeds the _ply.c_ and _ply.h_ files. These have been a little modified to compile without warnings. Unfornately, to my knowledge, the ply library was built specifically for 32-bits architectures, so if you are running on a 64-bits machine you'll not be able to use binary plys, only ascii plys.

Links to the complete ply library can be found at http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/

To convert from binary to ascii use the *ply2ascii* program in the ply library.

The accepted _ply_ files must have two more attributes besides the vertex coordinates:

  * Normals
  * Radius

These three attributes composes a _surfel_.

===Surfel Coordinates===

The 3D coordinates are expected to be normalized between [-1, +1].

===Surfel Normals===

Vertex normals may be computed using the ply library or by any other convenient method.

===Surfel Radius===

The radius of a surfel is its sampling
