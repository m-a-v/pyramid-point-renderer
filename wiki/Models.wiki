#summary Accepted input models.

= Introduction =

With the inclusion of the VCG library the old ply library was removed and any file accepted by the VCG import method can be used.

= Details =

The accepted files must have two more attributes besides the vertex coordinates:

  * Normals
  * Radius (for the time being it is set as "quality" in the file header to be compatible with VCG)

==Attributes==

These three attributes compose a _surfel_:

===Surfel Coordinates===

The 3D coordinates.

===Surfel Normals===

Per vertex normal.

===Surfel Radius===

The radius of a surfel corresponds to its sampling distance. This can be computed using the k-nearest neighbors of a sample.

===Precomputed Models===

Some models with precomputed normals and radius can be found here under the *Downloads* tab.
