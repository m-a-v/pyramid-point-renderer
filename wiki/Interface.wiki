#summary Understanding the basic commands.
= Introduction =

The Qt interface provides the main interface with the application. It still contain some debug purposes only widgets, but it is fairly simple to understand.

==Filter Sizes==

Two different filters were inherited from the _Surface Splatting_ method: the reconstruction  filter and the prefilter.

The reconstruction filter is a global size modifier for all ellipses, thus increasing it will enlarge all ellipses proportionally. 

The prefilter is added to reconstruction filter and is used for anti-aliasing purposes. Increasing the prefilter size tends to leave the splats more "round".

==Per Vertex Color==

If a models has _RGB_ attributes per vertex, the colors can be interpolated using the algorithm when this check box is enabled.

==Depth Test==

A flag for turning depth test _on/off_.

==LOD==

The *LOD* check box will only work for models with _.lod_ extension. It alternates between constant splat size rendering and using the lod structure.

The *LOD Colors* renders each resolution level splat with a different color, where the they are respectively from coarsest to finest: Ruby - Turquoise - Gold - Silver

==Colors Bar==

When rendering in *LOD* mode this check box renders on screen a colored graph depicting the usage of each level of resolution.

The color bars will in the future also work for the "Ellipse Rasterization" rendering mode.
