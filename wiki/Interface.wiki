#summary Understanding the interface.

= Introduction =

The Qt interface provides the main interface with the application. It still contain some debug purposes only widgets, but it is fairly simple to understand.

= Details =

Since this is a _Beta_ version, not all boxes are clickable safe, that is, they are not always enabled and disabled appropiately with each kind of model.

==Pyramid Points===

This is the basic Pyramid Point Rendering as described in:
[http://www.lcg.ufrj.br/Projetos/pbr]

==Tree Rendering==

Sorry, this mode is broken, I'll fix it in the next few days.

==Models with Level-of-Detail Structure==

The Lod check box for example should only be used when a _.lod_ model has been loaded.
The point-based LOD rendering is still a work in progress, thus the reason for its significant bad performance compared to the plain point rendering.

More details about this project can be found at:
[http://www.lcg.ufrj.br/Projetos/object-textures]

The color bars depicts the number/percentage of points being rendered at each of the four possible LOD levels, where the colors are respectively from coarsest to finest:
Ruby - Turquoise - Gold - Silver

==Ellipse Rasterization==

This mode is still at an early construction stage. More info about this will be available soon.
