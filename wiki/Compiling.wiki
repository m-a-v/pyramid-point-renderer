#summary Instructions on how to compile the code.

= Introduction =

The code is almost self-contained except mainly for the Qt4 dependecy,
however, the application classes are independent of the interface, thus
I hope to soon add also support to Glut.

= Details =

Before you compile:

  * Download the LcgTk library from [http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk/]

  * Have Qt4 installed.

  * Change the path to the LcgTk in the _pyramid-point-renderer.pro_ file.

In the pyramid-point-renderer type the following:

  * qmake-qt4 (Generates the Makefile)

  * make

Now execute _*pyramid-point-renderer*_
