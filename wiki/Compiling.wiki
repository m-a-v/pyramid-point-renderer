#summary Instructions on how to compile the code.

= Introduction =

The code is almost self-contained except for another library developed in our lab and GLee,
The application classes are independent of the interface, thus
I have substituted the Qt interface for a lightweight GLut based version.

= Details =

Requirements:

  * I have successfully tested this code in a variety of computers and configurations, including an HP tx1215 laptop with a nVidia 6150 graphics board. It should run on nVidia GeForce 5 series, but I have not yet tested.

Before you compile:

  * Have GLUT installed.

  * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk/ LcgTk] library and compile the glslKernel (run *make* in this subdirectory).

  * To use the glslKernel you also need to install GLee from Elf-stone [http://elf-stone.com/glee.php].

In the pyramid-point-renderer directory type the following:

  * make

  * ../ppr < plyfile >
