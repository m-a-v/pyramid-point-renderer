#summary Instructions on how to compile the code.

= Introduction =

The code is almost self-contained except mainly for the Qt4 dependency,
however, the application classes are independent of the interface, thus
I hope to soon add also support to Glut for a lightweight and more compatible version.

= Details =

Before you compile:

  * Download and compile at least the glslKernel of the [http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk/ LcgTk] library.

  * Have Qt4 installed.

  * Change the *!LcgTk* path in the _pyramid-point-renderer.pro_ file.

In the pyramid-point-renderer type the following:

  * qmake-qt4 (Generates the Makefile)

  * make

Now execute _*pyramid-point-renderer*_
