#summary Instructions on how to compile the code.

= Introduction =

The code is almost self-contained except mainly for the Qt4 dependency,
however, the application classes are independent of the interface, thus
I am at the moment building a lightweight GLut based version, it should be already working with the included makefiles but without any interface. You will
also need to have GLee installed.

= Details =

Requirements:

  * Up to this moment you do need a quite recent graphics card to use the system because it uses some functionalities from Shader Model 4. Some renderers should also work with Shader Model 3 with few modifications, but since it implies removing some functionalities I have not done it yet.

Before you compile:

  * Have GLUT installed.

  * Download and compile at least the glslKernel of the [http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk/ LcgTk] library.

  * To use the glslKernel you also need to install GLee from Elf-stone [http://elf-stone.com/glee.php].

  * Have Qt4 installed if you want the version with interface.

  * Change the *!LcgTk* path in the _pyramid-point-renderer.pro_ file.

In the pyramid-point-renderer type the following:

  * qmake-qt4 (Generates the Makefile, if you want the GLut version don't use this command, otherwise you will overwrite it's makefile)

  * make

Now execute _*pyramid-point-renderer*_ for the Qt version or _*pyramid-point-renderer <ply_model>*_ for the GLut version.
